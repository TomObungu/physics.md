## Oscillating motion
There are many examples of oscillating motion 
- A pendulum
- A ruler hanging over the edge of a desk
- Water in a U shaped tube

All objects in motion share similar characteristics. In each case the object starts in equilibrium position and force applied displaces the object, causing it to oscillate.

An oscillating object is displaced when released, then it travels towards equilibrium position at an increasing speed. It then slow down once it has gone past equilibrium and eventually reaches maximum displacement. This process repeats until the object reaches maximum negative displacement. This is the cycle of oscillation for an object.

## Oscillating motion terminology

The terms in harmonic motion are very similar to their wave counterparts. The term for phase difference $\phi$ is similar for harmonic motion as it is in waves. For example if two indentical pendulums reach their maximum displacements, then their phase is 0 ($\phi = 0rads$). Whereas if their phase difference is $\phi=\pi rads$ , one pendulum will be at its maximum positive and another will at its negative.

## Angular frequency
Angular frequency is a term used to describe of an oscillating object and is closely related to the angular velocity of an object. The equation of for angular frequency is the same as angular velocity, however it used only when the object is **oscillating**:
$$
\omega=\frac{2\pi}{T} \qquad or \qquad \omega=2\pi f
$$

Where T is the period of the oscillator and $f$ is the frequency. The frequency complete oscillations per second. This means the time taken to start from equilibrium, the move maximum displacement then to maximum negative displacement, then back to equilibrium displacement.

$T$ is the time period for one complete oscillation per second.

If you consider the motion of an object in circular motion, the displacement is given by $A\cos\theta$. The angle $\theta$ increases uniformly with time t, so the graph of displacement $x$ against will a graph of cosine

## Simple Harmonic Motion
Simple harmonic motion (SHM) is a common kind of oscillating motion defined as oscillating motion for which the acceleration of the object is given by:
$$
\alpha=-\omega^{2}x
$$

Where $\omega^{2}$ is a constant for the object. 

From the equation we can see two features of all objects in SHM:

- Acceleration $\alpha$ of the object is directly proportional to its displacement $x$, that is $\alpha \propto x$
- The minus sign means the acceleration acts in the opposite direction of displacement. (The accelerating force actively returns the force to equilibrium position)

A graph of $\alpha$ against $x$ for any object in SMH will show that gradient is equal to $w^{2}$  where $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the oscillating object. As the gradient is constant, the frequency is also constant. 

Another important factor of SHM is that the period T of the oscillator is independent of amplitude $A$ of the oscillator. 

This means as the amplitude increases so does the average speed of swing, so the, so the period does not change. 

This is because $v=\frac{x}{t}$ where $x$ is the displacement. However in order for the speed $v$ to increase, the time must stay the same or decrease as $v\propto \frac{1}{t}$

Such as oscillator is referred to as an isochronous oscillator.

## Worked Example
*A pendulum bob is in SHM with a period of 0.6s and an amplitude of 5cm. Calculate the frequency of the oscillations and the maximum acceleration of the bob.* 

1. $$
f = \frac{1}{0.6} = 1.7Hz
$$
2. $$
\omega=2\pi(1.7) = 10.4 rads^{-1}
$$
3. Since the maximum acceleration occurs at the maximum amplitude:$$
a=-\omega^{2}x
$$ becomes:
$$
\alpha=-\omega^{2}A = 10.4\dots^{2}\times_{0}.05 -5.5ms^-1
$$

## Determining the period and frequency of objects moving with SHM

Using a a simple pendulum and a mass attached to a string. You can time a number of oscillations using a stopwatch and show that the period is independent of the amplitude. 

The period of each oscillation can be measured using a stopwatch. Commonly, the time take for several complete oscillations is measured. 

A small pin or other marker can be placed at the equilibrium position. This marker provides a clear position from which to start and stop any timing measures.
