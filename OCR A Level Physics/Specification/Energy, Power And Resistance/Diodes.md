[[I-V Characteristics]] [[Circuit Diagrams]]
A diode only allows current in one particular direction. 
## Light-emitting diode (LEDs)
Some diodes are made of a material that emits light when they conduct. These LEDs emit light of a single specific wavelength. 

LEDs are very efficient and take very little energy to run. Because of this they can be used to indicate direction of current through a particular part of a circuit.

## I-V Characteristic for a diode
- The potential difference across a diode or LED is not directly porptional through it. This means:
	- A diode does not obey Ohm's law - It is a non-ohmic conductor
	- The resistance of the diode is not constant
- Diodes behavior depends on polarity

At A the resistance of the diode is very high. At B as the p.d increase, the resistance gradually starts to drop. For a silicone diode this happens around 0.7V. This value of p.d in which the resistance starts to drop in a diode is called the threshold p.d
