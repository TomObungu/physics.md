The electron gun is a device used to produce a narrow beam of electrons. The electrons can be used to ionize particles by adding or removing electrons. Can be used for electron microscopes.

A small metal filament is heated by an electric current. The electrons in the wire gain enough kinetic energy to escape from the surface of the metal. This is called thermionic emissions. 

Heated filament is placed in a vacuum and a high p.d is applied between the filament and an anode. The electrons will accelerate towards the anode, gaining kinetic energy. If the anode has small hole in it, the electrons in line with the whole can pass through it with a specific kinetic energy.

### Energy transfers
As electrons accelerate towards the anode and gain kinetic energy, the work done on a single electron is $eV$, where $e$ is the elementary charge and $V$ is the alternating p.d. This is because of the equation $W = VQ$ where $Q$ is represented with the value of $e$. 

by considering the law of the conservation of energy we can derive an equation relating the work done on the electron to its increase in kinetic energy. 
$$
\text{work done on an electorn = gain in kinetic energy}
$$
$$
 eV = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2}
$$
Changing the alternating p.d changes the kinetic energy of the electrons within the beam. The greater the p.d the more energy is transferred to the electrons and so the faster they move. 

#### Calculating the velocity of an electron
*Calculate the velocity of an electron from an electron gun with an accelerating p.d of 4kV*

1. $eV = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$ 
   $$
v = \sqrt{ \frac{2eV}{m} }
$$
2. $$
v = \sqrt{ \frac{2(1.60\times 10^{-19})(4000)}{9.11 \times 10^{-31} } }
$$
### Particle accerators
A linear particle accelerator (LINAC) uses a series of electrodes to accelerate sub atomic particles such as electrons. The polarity of electrons is alternated between positive and negative with precise timing so that each time the electrons leave of the tube, polarity changes in order to attract them to the next on. 

Each time and electron moves form one tube, it gains energy equal to $eV$. With a large number of tubes, electrons can be accelerated to high velocities. 

LINACs can be used to produce X-rays required for radiotherapy.

1. $$
100(eV) =  \frac{1}{2}mv^{2}
$$
$$
v = \sqrt{ \frac{200(eV)}{m} }
$$
$$
= \sqrt{ \frac{200(1.60\times 10^{-19})(50)}{9.11 \times 10^{-31}} }
$$
$$
 = 4.2 \times 10^{7}ms^{-1} 
$$
2. As the electrons velocity increases, the displacement the travel in the same duration of time increases. Thus, in order to maintain timing and leave the electrode at the correct time when the polarity changes. the tubes must increase in distance to ensure the electrons leaves the electrode at the same time in order to continue accelerating the electron.
