##  Cells, batteries, and power supplies
A battery in physics means two or more cells connected end-to-end in series. The longer terminal represents the positive terminal. 
When using a power supply, a small plus sign is placed next to the positive terminal. This is to ensure **polarity** is represented correctly. Polarity is very important when dealing with circuit components such as Diodes or LEDs.
