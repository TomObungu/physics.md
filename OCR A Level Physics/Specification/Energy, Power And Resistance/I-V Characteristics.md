## Gradient Of I-V Graph
The gradient of of an I-V graph is $\frac{1}{R}$ (the reciprocal of the resistance). This is because $R = \frac{V}{I}$, thus 
$\frac{1}{R} = \frac{I}{V}$
- The potential difference is directly proportional to the current. ($V \propto I$)
- A resistor obeys Ohm's law, and so can be described as an ohmic conductor
- The resistance (gradient) of the resistor is constant
-  The resistor behaves the same way regardless of polarity

# Filament Lamps
- Non-ohmic conduct
- The resistance of the filament lamp is not constant
- Behaves the same way regardless of polarity
- Resistance of the filament increases as the p.d across it increases

Why does resistance increase with temperature? E.g. In a filament lamp
Increase in resistance is caused by the wire getting so hot that it glows. As current increases, electrons collide with ions which causes the ions to vibrate more thus an increases in temperature and to collide with more still electrons
