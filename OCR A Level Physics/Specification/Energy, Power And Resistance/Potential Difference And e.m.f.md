# Potential Difference
Potential difference is the measure of the transfer of energy by charge carriers. 
### The volt 
One volt is p.d across a component when 1 J of energy is transferred per unit charge passing through the component
$$
1V = 1JC^{-1}
$$
A p.d of 1000v means 1000J per coulomb of charge. The term potential difference used when charged particles lose energy in a component. 
**Potential difference is defined as the energy transferred from electrical energy to other forms**
$$
V = \frac{W}{Q}
$$
where $Q$ is charge in coulombs and $W$ is the energy transferred by charge Q
### Voltmeter
 An ideal voltmeter should have an infinite resistance. Used to measure p.d. They are always connected in parallel across a particular component.

## Electromotive Force
Potential difference describes when work is done by the charge carriers. 
Electromotive force (e.m.f) is used to describe when work is done on the charge carries. The charges have energy being transferred to them as they pass through a component like a cell, battery or power pack. The greater the e.m.f has been transferred (often from chemical energy in a cell) to it. 

**Electromotive force is defined as the energy transferred from chemical energy (or another form) to electrical energy per unit charge. **
$$
\varepsilon = \frac{W}{Q}
$$

## Calculating energy transfer
The energy transferred depends on the size of the p.d and the charge passing through the component.
$$
W = VQ
$$
or
$$
W=\varepsilon Q
$$
