The resistance of a component in a circuit can be determined by measuring the current $I$ and the p.d $V$.

Resistance is the measure of how difficult it is for current to flow through a component in a circuit
### The Ohm
An ohm is defined as the resistance of a component when a p.d of 1V is produced per ampere of current.
$$
1 \Omega = 1VA^{-1}
$$
### Ohm's Law
At constant temperature, the current in a wire is directly proportional to the potential difference across it.
## Temperature and resistance
For a tightly bundled metallic wire. The p.d across the wire remains constant at 1.5V, but the current in the wire decreases with time. The shape of the graph can be explained as the resistance decreasing with time.

When the temperature of wire increases, the positive ions inside the wire have more internal energy and vibrate with greater amplitude about their mean positions. The frequency of the collisions between the charge carriers and ions increases and so the charge carriers do more work which in turn transfers more energy as they travel through the wire.
