## Temperature and number density
Some semiconductor components have a **negative temperature coefficient (NTC),** meaning that their **resistance drops as the temperature increases.** 

As the temperature increases, the number density of the charge carriers also increases. This mostly due to temperature increase causing the positive ions to delocalize their electrons. 
 
Knowing from $I = Anev$ where $n$ is the number density, an increases in $n$ , increases the current $I$. 

Knowing from $R = \frac{V}{I}$ this means that $R \propto \frac{1}{I}$ thus as the current increases, that resistance decreases.

As the temperature decreases the positive ions lose energy and thus the electrons return to the outer shell of the metal molecules.

A thermistor is an electrical component made from a semiconductor with a negative temperature coeffect. As the the temperature of the thermistor increases, its resistance drops.

Uses:
- Simple thermometers
- Thermostats to control heating and air-conditioning units 
- Monitor temperature components inside electrical devices like computers and smartphones

#### Thermistor experiment
An investigation into how the resistance of a thermistor changes with temperature can be carried using an ohmmeter and water bath. 

Alternatively, an ammeter and a voltmeter can be used to measure current in the thermistor and p.d across it different temperatures. The resistance can then be calculated using $R=\frac{V}{I}$

### I-v Characteristic of thermistor
Similar to a filament lamp, thermistors are non-ohmic. 
As the current increases, the temperature increases, however this leads to a drop in resistance.
