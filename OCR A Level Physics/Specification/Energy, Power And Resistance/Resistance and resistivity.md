[[Resistance]] [[Mean Drift Velocity]]
The material of a substance can affect the resistance. Other factors include:
- Temperature
- Cross-sectional are of the wire L
- The length of the wire
## Resistivity
The term resistivity is used to determine the electrical property of a material. Resistivity is a measure of how difficult is is for charge to travel through a material. The unit for resistivity is ohm meters ($\Omega m$)

## Resistance and length
For any given current, increasing the length of the wire will increase the p.d across it. The resistance of a wire is directly proportional to its length L.  $$
R \propto L
$$
## Resistance and cross-sectional area
When the cross-sectional area of the wire increases, the resistance drops. Wires with a greater cross-sectional area have a lower resistance.

The resistance R of a wire is inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area A.
$$
R \propto \frac{1}{A}
$$
## Calculating resistance from resistivity
Combining the two relationships gives:
$$
R \propto \frac{L}{A}
$$
$$
R = k\left( \frac{L}{A} \right)
$$
The constant of proportionality in this equation is the resistivity which is the value k. Thus to add definition to the value of k, it is possible to represent k as $\rho$ . Thus giving the equation
$$
R = \frac{\rho L}{A}
$$
**This equation may used for a known constant temperature. The resistivity of a material is affected by its temperature**
## Defining resistivity
Rearranging the above equations gives:
$$
\rho = \frac{RA}{L}
$$
## Determining Resistivity ($\rho$)
- A piece of wire is required - some include copper, constantan and nichrome

- Set up this circuit
	- ![[Pasted image 20250901113606.png]]
		- Ammeter
		- Voltmeter in parrel to the wire
		- Variable d.c supply
		-  Crocodile clips to connect each end of the wire to the circuit

- Using the voltmeter measure the p.d across different lengths of wire. If the current in each wire is measured, use $R = \frac{V}{I}$ to calculate the resistance for each length.

- As $R \propto L$ a graph of $R$ against $R$ is a straight line through the origin. By considering the general equation for a straight line  ($y = mx + c$) and the equation $R = \frac{\rho L}{A}$ The gradient of the graph is $\frac{\rho}{A}$ 

- The resistivity rho can be determined by multiplying the gradient of the graph by the cross-sectional area of the wire.
