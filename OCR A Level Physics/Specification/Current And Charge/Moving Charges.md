## Flow of charges
Electric current is just the flow of any type of charge carrier - an electron is just on possibility. In metals the charge carrier is electrons, however in liquids, the charge carrier tends to be ions. The electric current in nerve cells in your brain involves sodium and potassium ions passing through different parts of the membrane in surrounding each cell.
## Current in metals
A small number of electrons from each atoms in the metal are **delocalized - free to move.**

**The structure of a metal can thought of as regular crystal structure or a lattice**
	One way to make electrons move is to make one end of the wire positive and one end negative. This is through removing electrons on one end and adding electrons on another. 
This movement produces current. The greater the rate of flow the greater the current. A larger current may be due to: 
- **A greater number of electrons moving past a given point each second (for example a wire with a greater cross sectional area**
- **The same number of electrons moving faster through the metal**
## Conventional current
Conventional current visually presents current moving from **positive to negative regardless of the actual direction of the charge carriers**. In reality, **electrons** **in metals travel from the negative terminal towards the positive.**

## Electric currents in electrolytes
Liquids that can carry an electric current are called **electrolytes.** In this case the electric current is the flow of ions. All electrolytes are either **molten ionic compounds** or **ionic solutions**. Pure water is an excellent insulator. However water from taps and rivers are ionic solutions and so can carry an electric current.

A common example of an ionic solution is salt (Sodium Chloride, NaCl ) dissolved in water. The salt separates into positively charged sodium ions (**cations**) and some negatively charged chlorine ions (**anions**), Cl$^{-}$ .

If a positive electrode **(anode)** and a negative electrode **(cathode)** are placed in the solution, ions are attracted to the electrodes. The Na$^{+}$ ions move towards the cathode and the Cl$^{-}$ ions move towards the anode. This movement is a flow of charge - an electric current. 

## Measuring electric current
An ammeter is always placed in series. Ammet
