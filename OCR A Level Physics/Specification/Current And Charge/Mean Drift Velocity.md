The number of free charge carriers per unit volume is called the number density. The higher the number density, the greater the number of free electrons per $m^{3}$ so the better the electrical conductor [[Current and Charge]] [[Moving Charges]]
## Classification of materials
Conductors have a very high number density of order $10^{28}m^{-3}$, insulators have a much lower value with semiconductors having a value of around $10^{17}m^{-3}$

In order for semiconductors to carry the same amount of current the electrons need to move much faster. This increases the temperature of the semiconductors. 
## How fast do charge carriers move?
Most charge carriers like electrons move slowly. Free electrons repeatedly collide positive metal ions as they drift through the wire towards the positive terminal. The reason why lights turn on so quickly is because all the free electrons in the wire start moving almost all at once

##  $I = Anev$
This is an equation for electric current. $I$ is the the current in amperes, $A$ is the cross sectional area of the conductor in $m^{2}$, $e$ is the elementary charge constant ($1.602 \times 10^{-19}C$), $n$ is the number density of the material, and $v$ is the mean drift velocity.

## Derivation of $I = Anev$
The equation is derived by considering the number density and dimensions of a conductor.
From its definition:
$$
I=\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}

$$
	The  number of electrons in a given volume $V$ of a conductor is $nV$  
	The total charge of the electrons in this volume of conductor is $neV$ where $e$ is the elementary charge constant
This gives
$$
I = \frac{neV}{\Delta t}
$$
	The volume of the electric current in a conductor depends on the cross-sectional area A of a conductor and the mean drift velocity $v$ of the charge carriers

$$
\frac{V}{\Delta t} = Av
$$

Substituting this into the previous equation for electric current gives, 
$$
I = ne\left( \frac{v}{\Delta t} \right) = neAv
$$
Or more commonly written as
$$
I = Anev
$$

### Example - Calculating mean drift velocity
*A copper wire has a cross sectional area of  $7.85 \times 10^{-7} m^{2}$ . The number density of copper is $8.5 \times 10^{28}m^{-3}$. Calculate the mean drift velocity of the wire when there is a current of 1.40 A*
1. $$
I = Anev
$$
$$
v = \frac{I}{Ane}
$$
2. $$
v = \frac{1.4}{7.85 \times 10^{-7} m^{2}(8.5 \times 10^{28}m^{-3})(1.602 \times 10^{-19})}
$$
$$
v = 1.31 \times 10^{-4}ms^{-1}
$$
