## Current
The flow of charged particles produces and electric current.
Electric current is measured in amperes. The ampere is one of the seven SI base units.
**Electric current is defined as the rate of flow of charge.**
$$
I=\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}
$$
where $I$ is the current in amps. $\Delta Q$ is the charge transferred in coulombs, and $\Delta t$ is the time in seconds.
One ampere of charge is the same as one coulomb of charge passing through a given point, per second ($1Cs^-1$), 12kA is the same as 12000 coulombs per second.

The elementary constant or $e$ is the charge of a single electron and has a value of approximately $1.602\times 10^-19$ C. Thus the amount of electrons that pass through a point with a charge of 1C per second is:
$$
\frac{1}{e} \approx \frac{1}{1.602\times 10^-19} \approx 6.25\times 10^{18} \text{ electrons in 1C}
$$
Thus a current of 1A in a wire with the charge carrier of electrons is $6.25\times 10^{18}$ electrons travelling through the wire at a given point per second.
## Electric Charge
Electric charge is a physical property. Some particles are charged like **protons** and **electrons** and others have no charge like neutrons. 
There are two types of charge - positive and negative. Like charges repel and opposite charges attract. 

Electric charge is measured in Coulombs $(C)$. It is defined as:
**The electric charge flowing past a point in one second when there is an electric current of one ampere**

This is expressed in the formula
$$
\Delta Q = I\Delta t
$$
From this equation $1C$ has base units $1A s$
Any particle with an electric charge is a charge carrier. Below is table of some notable charge carriers.

| Charge Carrier     | Charge/C              |
| ------------------ | --------------------- |
| proton             | $1.602\times 10^-19$  |
| electron           | $-1.602\times 10^-19$ |
| copper$^{2+}$ ion  | $3.204\times 10^-19$  |
| sodium$^{+}$ ion   | $1.602\times 10^-19$  |
| chloride$^{-}$ ion | $-1.602\times 10^-19$ |
It is familiar to measure charges using +1 or -2 but these are relative charges that are measured against the elementary constant $e$. A proton has a relative charge of +1$e$ and an electron as relative charge of -1$e$
If we know the value of a current in a metal wire, we can calculate the charge passing through the it in a given time and even the number of electrons. 
### Example
*The current in a lamp is 6.2A. Calculate the number of electrons passing through one point in the lamp in 2 minutes*

1. Identify the correct equation
$$
I=\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}
$$
$$
\Delta Q = I\Delta t
$$
2. Substitute values
$$
\Delta Q = 6.2 \times 120 = 744C
$$
3. To calculate the number of electrons, divide the charge is coulombs by the elementary constant $e$
$$
\text{number of electrons} = \frac{744}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} = 4.65 \times 10 ^{21}
$$
## Net Charge
The charge on most objects results in either a gain electrons or a loss. **If electrons have been added to electron, it will become negatively charged**. **If electrons have been removed from an object it will become positively charged.** 

The net charge of an object is given by
$$
Q=\pm ne
$$
	where $Q$ is the net charge of the object in coulombs, $n$ is the number of electrons (either added or removed) and $e$ is the elementary charge
#### Quantized values
The charge on an object is **quantized or discrete** - **these values must only be integer multiples of $e$**
## Millikan's experiment
In 1909, Robert Millikan and Harvey Fetcher, carried out the 'oil drop experiment'. They analyzed the motion of electrically charged oil droplets between two oppositely charged parallel plates. Oil droplets experienced gravitational force, air resistance, and upthrust. 

The occasional droplet was held stationary as the downwards gravitational force was balanced by the upward attractive electrostatic force whilst others drifted through the electric field. 

Millikan measured the charge on the droplets and found that the charge on the droplets was quantized; It did not just take any value, but only values that were multiples of $e$
