[[Moving Charges]]
## Conservation of charge
The conservation of charge states that electric charge can neither be created nor destroyed. The total amount of electric charge in the universe is constant. 

## First law
For any point in an electrical circuit, the sum of currents into that point is equal to the sum of the currents out of that point.

The law can be written as 
$$
\Sigma I_{in} = \Sigma I_{out}
$$
