## The Radian
The SI unit for angle is the radian.  
A radian is the angle subtended by a circular arc length with a length equal to the circle.

Angle in radians = $\text{}\frac{\text{arc length}}{radius}$

## Angular Velocity
Any object moving in a circle or a circular path moves through an angle $\theta$ in a certain time t. The angular velocity $\omega$ is defined as the rate of change of the angle. Therefore:
$$
\omega=\frac{\theta}{t}
$$
In a time equal to $T$, the object will move through an angle $\theta$ equal to $2\pi$ radians. Therefore

$$
\omega =\frac{2\pi}{T}
$$
Measured in $rads^-1$
As $f$ is the reciprocal of the period T - $\frac{1}{T}$ - Then $f=\frac{1}{T}$. Thus 
$$
\omega=2\pi f
$$

Angle velocity can be expressed in several different unit, including $^\circ s^{-1}$, revolutions per second ($revs ^{-1}$) or rounds per minute (rpm).

## Worked example 
*A spinning hard disk takes 8.33ms to complete one full revolution. Calculate its angular velocity in $rads ^{-1}$ and revolutions per second*
1. $$
\omega=2\pi\left( \frac{1}{8.33\times 10^{-3}} \right) = 754 \  \ rads ^{-1}
$$
2. $$
f=\frac{1}{8.33\times 10^{-3}} = 120 revs ^{-1}
$$
