Combing angular acceleration with the equation for centripetal acceleration, $a=\frac{v^{2}}{r}$, we can determine an expression for centripetal force. 
$$
F=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}
$$
This is for constant mass m and radius r, the centripetal force F is directly proportional to $v^{2}$. That is $F\propto v^{2}$. Since $v=\omega r$ the centripetal force can also be written in terms of the angular velocity $\omega$ as :
$$
F=\frac{m(\omega r)^{2}}{r}=\frac{m\omega^{2}r^{2}}{r}
$$
or
$$
F=m\omega^{2}r
$$
The force F is always towards the centre of the circular path. 
## Investing circular motion
As the bung is swung in a horizontal circle the suspended weight remains stationary as long as the force it provides (Mg) is equal to the centripetal force required to make the bung travel in the circular path.

If the centripetal force required
is greater than the weight then the weight moves upwards. The paperclip acts as a marker

The weight and thus the centripetal force required for different masses, radii, and speeds can all be investigated by calculating the angular velocity and radius.
## Worked example:
*A racing car of mass 1200kg travels around a bend with a radius of 140m. The maximum frictional force between the wheels and the track is 17kN. Calculate the maximum speed at which the car can travel around the bend.*

1. $$ 
\begin{gather*}
F=\frac{mv^{2}}{r} \\ 
v = \sqrt{ \frac{Fr}{m} }
\end{gather*}
$$
2. $$
v=\sqrt{ \frac{1.7\times 10^{4} \times 140}{1200} } = 45ms^{-1}
$$
## The centrifuge 
![[Pasted image 20250910022950.png]]
The centrifuge works by spinning liquids at a high speed. The particles in the liquid separate out as the tube holding them is spun. When spinning, the tubes swing out so they are horizontal. Particles with a greater mass require greater centripetal force to follow the circular path, and so move outwards to the bottom of the tube. Lighter particles in blood end up near the top of the tube.

## Banked surfaces
The greater the speed of an object following a circular path, the greater the centripetal force required to make it follow this path. A car must slow down down approaching a bend in order the maximum frictional force between the tires and the road is sufficient to provide the required centripetal force. If the car travels too fast it will follow a path of greater radius and leave the road.

The tracks in modern velodromes are banked up to angles of $45^\circ$ such that a horizontal component of the normal contact force, together with the frictional force from the tires, provides the centripetal force required to follow the circular path at high speeds.

## At the fairground
A centripetal force can be due to changes in the normal contact force when an object is made to travel in a circular path. For example in a Ferris wheel. If the capsule is at the top of the ride N reduces, resulting in a net force towards the center of the circle. This also gives you a feeling of slightly reduces weight. The opposite is true at the bottom of the ride, where N increases providing a net force upwards towards the center of the circle.

## The conical pendulum
A conical pendulum rotates at a constant speed, describing a horizontal circle. The time take to complete each rotation depends only on the length of the pendulum string and the gravitational field strength. 
![[Pasted image 20250910025827.png]]
Such uses of a conical pendulum have been used for smooth timing mechanisms were required to calibrate the tracking of sensitive telescopes.

It is possible to derive an expression relating to the angle of the pendulum $\theta$ to its speed $v$ and its radius $r$.

The horizontal component of the tensions $F_{T}$ in the string provides the centripetal force $F$ required for the circular motion of the pendulum
$$
F_{T}\sin\theta=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}
$$
The vertical component of the tension must be equal to the weight of the pendulum bob, because there is no acceleration in the vertical direction. 
$$
F_{T}\cos\theta=mg
$$
Dividing the first equation by the second:
$$
\tan\theta=\frac{v^{2}}{rg}
$$
Thus the angle of the pendulum is not affected by the mass of the pendulum bob.
