## Loading and unloading 
The extension of a material increases as the force increases, then decreases again as the force is reduced. Different materials have different loading and unloading curves.

### Metal wire
A metal wire follows Hooke's law until the elastic limit of the wire. The unloading graph will be identical for forces less than the elastic limit. However in plastic deformation, the unloading graph is parallel to the loading graph but not identical to it. The wire is permanently extended after the force is removed.

### Rubber
Rubber bands do not obey Hooke's law. The rubber band will return to its original length after the force is removed - elastic deformation. However the loading and unloading graphs are both curved and different. 
The loop formed by the loading and unloading curves is called a hysteresis loop. The area under the loading graph is greater than of the unloading graph. This means more work is done when stretching a rubber band than is done when its extension decreases again. The area of the hysteresis loop is the thermal energy released when the material is loading and unloaded.

### Polythene 
A polythene strip does not obey Hooke's law. Polythene is very easy to stretch and undergo plastic deformation under little force. In the figure below the polythene material will have a curved loading graph however due to polythene undergoing plastic deformation under little forces, the polythene material unloads into a new permanent position.

1. As rubber consists of tangled long-chain molecules. The molecules can be untangled easily using small forces. However as the molecules are untangled they are not extended. This explains the sudden increase in force but little extension at the beginning of the graph. However once the rubber is being extended, the molecules can be extended easily up to a certain point. Past that point they require large forces to extend any further. 
2. Rubber undergoes elastic deformation however, during unloading, the work done is less than the work done in loading. This means energy is lost as thermal energy during unloading. 
3.  a. The kinetic energy produced by the force generated by the airplane landings is transferred into the rubber tires and causes the tires to load and extend and is instead released as thermal energy rather than being transferred through the plane.  
4. b The work done absorbed from landing causes the rubber tires to extend during loading. When the rubber unloads, some of the energy is released as thermal energy which causes the tires to heat up.
