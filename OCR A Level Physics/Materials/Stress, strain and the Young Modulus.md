## Stretching materials
The extension of a extended wire will depend on the original length of the wire, its diameter, the tension in the wire and the material of the wire. The terms of materials under tensile forces are **tensile stress** and **tensile strain** 

### Tensile stress
Tensile stress is defined as the force applied per unit cross-sectional area of the wire
$$
\text{tensile stress} = \frac{\text{force}}{\text{cross-sectional area}}
$$
You can write it as 
$$
\sigma = \frac{F}{A}
$$
where $\sigma$ is the tensile stress (unit **Pascals** or $Nm^-2$ ), F is the applied force, and A is the cross sectional area. 

### Tensile strain
Tensile strain is defined as the fractional change in the original length of the wire. 
$$
\text{tensile strain} =  \frac{\text{extension}}{\text{original length}}
$$
You can write this as 
$$
\varepsilon = \frac{x}{L}
$$
where $\epsilon$ is the tensile strain, x is the extension of the material and L is the original length. The tensile strain is the ration of two lengths, so it has no units. Sometimes strain is written as a percentage, for example, 6.4% instead of 0.064

### Stress-strain graph for a metal
#StressStrainGraph
Figure 2 shows a typical stress against strain graph for mild steel, a ductile material. A ductile material can easily be drawn into a wire or hammered into thin sheets.

Up until point P from the origin, the stress is directly proportional to the the strain. P is the limit of proportionality. The material obeys Hooke's law in this linear region. 
E represents the elastic limit. Materials may obey Hooke's law up to this limit but not always - Elastic deformation occurs up to the elastic limit and plastic deformation beyond it. 

$Y_{1}$ and $Y_{2}$ are yield points, these are areas where the material extends rapidly. This part of the curve is typical of mild steel but may be absent from other ductile materials.

The stress point labelled UTS represents the ultimate tensile strength. This is the maximum stress that a material can withstand before breaking. 

Beyond this point, necking occurs - a process where the material becomes longer and thinner at its weakest point. The material eventually snaps at its breaking point, labelled B. The stress value at the point of fracture is known as the breaking strength of the material. 

A strong material is one with a high ultimate tensile strength. For example copper is stronger than lead, but mild steel is stronger than copper. This means mild steel has a higher ultimate tensile strength than copper.#

## The Young Modulus E
#YoungModulus 
Stress is directly proportional to strain. The ratio of stress to strain is a constant known as the Young Modulus, E.

$$
\text{Young Modulus} = \frac{\text{tensile stress}}{\text{tensile strain}}
$$
or 
$$
E = \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon}
$$
 The unit of the Young modulus is the same as the unit for stress which is $Nm^-2$ or **Pa** (Pascals)

The Young Modulus is the gradient of the linear region of the stress-strain graph

$$
y=mx + c
$$
is the same as 
$$
\sigma = E\varepsilon
$$
Thus the Young Modulus depends on the material, not its shape or size. 

$$
E = \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon}
$$
## Determining the Young Modulus Of A Wire
To determine Young Modulus of a material
1. Measure its diameter
2. Apply various loads to it
3. Measure its length each time

###  Apparatus
A wire of starting length 1m clamped securely at one end, passed over a pulley, and loaded with slotted masses. 

Always wear eye protection in case the wire breaks.

### Method
The diameter d of the wire can be measured using a micrometer. 
The cross section area of the wire **A** can be calculated from $A=\frac{\pi d^2}{4}$. Obtain an accurate measurement of diameter by averaging measurements from several places along the wire. 
Tensile force can be calculated using $F=mg$
Apply each additional mass, the extension can be calculated using $x=\text{extended length - original length L}$. Improve accuracy by taking readings for at least six different masses, and repeating them. 
The stress and strain values of each load of mass can be calculated to plot a stress-strain graph. 
The Young Modulus is the gradient of the linear section of the graph.

## Stress-strain graphs
Stress-strain graph for a **brittle material**, e.g. cast iron or glass. A brittle material shows elastic behavior up to its braking point, without any plastic deformation.

Stress-strain graph for polymeric material -  material the consists of long molecular chains. e.g. rubber or polythene. Both rubber and polythene can stretch a great deal however rubber is elastic behavior with a hysteresis loop whilst polythene shows plastic behavior.

## Storing energy per unit volume

1. 
![[Pasted image 20250826122228.png]]
$$
Area \approx \frac{\sigma\varepsilon}{2}
$$
$$
\approx \frac{1}{2}\frac{F}{A} \frac{x}{L}
$$
$$
\approx{ \frac{\frac{1}{2}Fx}{V}}
$$
$$
\approx \frac{\text{elastic potential energy}}{V}
$$
This is the energy per unit volume
2. 
$$
\sigma=\frac{F}{A}
$$
$$
= Nm^-2
$$
$$
\frac{w}{v} = \frac{Nm}{m^3} = Nm^-2
$$
They have the same unit
3. 
$$
120\times 10^6 = \frac{\sigma\varepsilon}{2}
$$
$$
\sigma=2()120\times 10^6)\varepsilon
$$
$$
\sigma=2(120\times 10^6)(2.5)
$$
 $$
 = 6\times 10^8 Pa
$$
Assumption silk obeys Hooke's law and the silk is stretching to its maximum extension of 40% more its original length.
