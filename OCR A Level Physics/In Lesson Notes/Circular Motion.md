As an on object such as the moon orbits the Earth.  The magnitude of the velocity is constant however the direction is changing - the velocity is changing. It is accelerating. 

Convert from $kmh^{-1}$ to ms
$$
\frac{kmh^{-1} \times 10^{3}}{3600}
$$

angle in radians = $\frac{\text{arc legnth}}{radians}$

convert to radians from $x$ degrees:
$$
\frac{x}{180}\pi
$$

### Angular velocity
$$
\omega=\frac{\theta}{t}
$$
Where $\theta$ is the angle and t is the time
One full revolution = $2\pi$, thus:
$$
\omega =\frac{2\pi}{T}
$$
Measured in $rads^-1$

Can write period as $\frac{1}{T}$ or $f=\frac{1}{T}$
$$
\omega=2\pi f
$$

## Centripetal Accelerating
An objects velocity accelerates towards the center of motion; The force is directed to the center of motion.
An object with constant speed but it is still accelerating. This is tangential velocity - This means the object is always perpendicular to the center of.
In this diagram the force is caused by the tension in the string.
The greater the change in velocity, the greater the acceleration.

## Equation for centripetal acceleration
$$
a=\frac{v^{2}}{r}
$$

### Derivation
![[Pasted image 20250905111605.png]]
$$
\begin{gather*}
ds = rd\theta \implies d\theta = \frac{ds}{r} = \frac{vdt}{r} \\
d\theta = \frac{dv}{v} = \frac{vdt}{r} \\
=  \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{v^{2}}{r} = a \\
\text{Combining with } v = \omega r \\
a = \omega^{2}r
\end{gather*}
