1. The point where the object experiences zero acceleration and therefore no resultant force
2. $2\pi$
3. $\omega=2\pi f$

displace has position x

phase difference - difference in displacement for two waves

angular velocity is the physical change in angle per second

angular frequency is 

motion along x-axis:
$A\cos\theta$

motion along y-axis:
$A\sin \theta$

SHM
- Maximum displacement (amplitude) at extremes of oscillation
- Greatest velocity and equilibrium position
- Acceleration is maximum at extremes of oscillation
- Acceleration is $\propto$ -x
