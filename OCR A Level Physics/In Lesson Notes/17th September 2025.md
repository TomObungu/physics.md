5. An isochronus oscillator is when the period of oscillation remains constant regardless of the amplitude.

displace has position x

phase difference - difference in displacement for two waves

angular velocity is the physical change in angle per second

angular frequency is 

motion along x-axis:
$A\cos\theta$

motion along y-axis:
$A\sin \theta$

SHM
- Maximum displacement (amplitude) at extremes of oscillation
- Greatest velocity and equilibrium position
- Acceleration is maximum at extremes of oscillation
- $a$ $\propto$ -$x$
- Acceleration is 0 at equilibrium position 
- Acceleration acts opposite to motion


isochronus means the period t is not dependant on the amplitude. Meaning the time period of of the oscillator is the same regardless of amplitude.
