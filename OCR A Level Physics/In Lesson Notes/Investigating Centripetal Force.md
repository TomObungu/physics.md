The centripetal force practical will have the bung spinning in a somewhat conical motion due to the mass of the bung causing a force of weight downwards. Thus the net force will not be perpendicular and so there shape of rotation will not be perfectly circular

Equipment
- string
- stopwatch
- scale to measure in radians
Method
- Whirl bung with constant frequency and radius in horizontal circle
- Measure time for several and calculate average 
- Measure radius by stopping cord
- Vary mass and calculate v for each mass keeping r the same

Plot F against $v^{2}$
